      Mayak eggs are a popular Korean street food. They are eggs that are
      boiled, peeled, and then marinated in a sweet and spicy sauce. The eggs
      are then skewered and served on a stick. They are a delicious and
      satisfying snack that is perfect for any time of day. &emsp; Basically
      drugs in egg form. 10/10 would recommend :D
